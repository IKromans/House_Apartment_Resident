# House_Apartment_Resident.cs

Hey! Welcome to my Rest API, which saves data about Houses, Apartments, and Resident stores them in a memory database and can perform CRUD operations with them.

Code is in C#, I used ASP.NET Core version 7.0 and Swagger UI tool that allows to interact with the API's endpoints.

To run application:

> clone this repository `https://github.com/IKromans/House_Apartment_Resident.cs.git`

> navigate to folder where `House_Apartment_Resident` projct file is located, open terminal and type `dotnet run`.

> now open the given localhost address in your web browser, remember to add `/swagger` like so:

Now you can try adding some data and then retrive them. With Swagger tool it is very simple, just pick your endpoint, enter data and execute method.

Enjoy!
