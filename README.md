# House_Apartment_Resident.cs

Hey! Welcome to my Rest API, which saves data about Houses, Apartments, and Resident stores them in a memory database and can perform CRUD operations with them.

Code is in C#, I used ASP.NET Core version 7.0 and Swagger UI tool that allows to interact with the API's endpoints.

To run application:

> clone this repository `https://github.com/IKromans/House_Apartment_Resident.cs.git`

> 

>

You can try adding new data and then retrive them. With Swagger it is very simple.

Enjoy!
